> Here is how to go about using the code yourself **_(est time for completion 5-10 mins)_**:
> **MAKE SURE PYTHON 3.8 AND ABOVE IS ALREADY INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER BEFORE DOING THIS!**

## Step 1:
- Download all the files provided and keep them in the same folder

## Step 2:

- Go to your terminal/command prompt/command line and type in `pip install pynput`. After that, do `pip install pyautogui Pillow`.

**And now you're done!**

> Simply run the main.py file, Type **"y"** to run and **"n"** to stop the program (type this on terminal)  and switch to a private server. Keep in mind to use a private server, as using a public server could have several serious bugs with the 'pls search' clicker. If thing go wrong and you need to stop the program, go to the window where you are running the program, go to the terminal and `press control+c`. **This should stop the program immediately.**
